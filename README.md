## About Me 

As a full-stack developer, I understand the importance of creating a seamless flow between the front and back-end aspects of an application. I have a keen eye for aesthetics and user experience. 

I'm currently making a living with my programming and problem-solving skills to debug code, identifying, addressing, troubleshooting and resolving issues at both the front-end and back-end levels of an application. 

My dream is to contribute code to make the world a better, safer and more unbiased place.

Outside of tech, I love animals, videogames, traveling, eating, cooking, creating and appreciating art, playing and listening to music, and raising my daughter!
